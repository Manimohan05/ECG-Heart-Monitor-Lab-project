# ECG heart monitor-2023
## Overview

In the human body, Heart is a main part. Itâ€™s like the CPU in the human body. The heart
will control all activities of a human by sending a pulse to the brain and the parts. 
If a difference in the heart pulse (heart rate) then it may cause death also. (Heart rate or pulse
is the process of generation of the internal electrical signal.)
So, we need to monitor the heartbeat rate regularly, So that we need to know the pulse rate
of the internal electrical signal.

## Product description

A gadget that can show a real-time electrical reading of the human heart is called a heart
ECG monitor. A suitable device should be used to show the signal. Given that the electrical
impulses generated by the human body are generally of low magnitude, We have applied our
analog electronics expertise to enhance signal quality while amplifying the necessary signals.
We have to construct an analog front end that accepts data from the ECG probes and outputs
a clean waveform of the ECG.
